**Please check again later for a completed post, the following is merely an outline.**





## Introduction
Hello again. In my previous visualization post we discussed how to plot graphs when you are looking at exactly 1 feature, this time we will continue our learning by moving on to 2 features and further!

## Pandas
### Downloading a dataset
Before we begin, we need to download a dataset to work with. To do so, we will be using ...


### Inspecting the dataset
Now we will find out exactly what data we are working with. By this, I mean that we will check exactly how the information is stored within our DataFrame. 


## Relationship Graphs (2 Features)
In a previous post we’ve looked at visualizations that focus on one variable at a time. These are great for showing distributions, but often in data science, what we care about is the relationship between at least two variables.

In this section, we’ll cover how to use matplotlib to show relationships between pairs of features in our dataset.

The first type of plot we’ll cover is the scatter plot.

### Scatterplot


### Lineplot


### Barplot 


## 3D Graphs
For this section, we will only cover how to use the scatterplot we are familiar with to move from a 2D into a 3D setting.

### Scatterplot


## Conclusion
