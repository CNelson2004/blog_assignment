    A short welcome/introduction (1â€“2 paragraphs).

    A clear statement of purpose for the blog (what readers can expect, what topics interest you).

    A clean layout that uses headings, lists, or other formatting appropriately


# Welcome to my blog!

Here you can find blog posts on various topics in data science. Currently the posts only cover visualization, since that is what I am most interested in, but expect to see future posts on Pandas, Numpy, and other useful libraries to help you in your data science journey. Don't simply expect to know how to use these libraries by reading these posts, but expect to be able to use them well. 

Concerning our visualization blog posts. Currently, this blog covers the basic of Matplotlib. The first blog post, (An Introduction to Visualizations in Python), shows you how to plot a single factor, even if that factor exists in multiple datasets. Additionally, it gives an in-depth coverage of basic plots, such as histograms, boxplots, and density functions. If you have read that post, then you understand how in depth I go into every function so that way you not only can use the plotting functions, but can customize them to look however you wish. You can expect this same quality 

Additionally, since it is an introductory post, you will also find the basics of creating a small dataset to play with pandas, and some universal Matplotlib functions that apply to any graph that you are creating.

In our second post we will continue to explore Matplotlib by looking at graphs that show two features against each other, such as in scatterplots. 

For future posts, expect
