    Skills – Technical skills, tools, programming languages, soft skills.

    Get to Know Me – Hobbies, interests, fun facts (something that gives personality beyond the résumé).

## Get to Know Me

Greetings:

- I'm currently a Junior at BYU studying data science. 
- I'm interested in studying data science and using it to solve real world problems.
- I am currently pursuing a career as a data scientist or a data analyst. 
- I'm experienced in SQL, C++, C, Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Java. I have previously made a chess game with a corresponding server/client servers, and a Datalog program from scratch.

### Goals
- In the short-term I hope to improve my understanding of common Data Science tools and improve my usage of them.
- In the long-term I simply want a stable career in the field of data science. 
- Overall I want to solve problems that affect every day people and help make their life easier, whether directly or indirectly.
