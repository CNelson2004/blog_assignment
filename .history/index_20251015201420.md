# Welcome to my blog!

Here, not only do I care about data, but I care about how it is shown. Therefore, the main point of this blog is on the visualization of data through libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, but you can also find posts about how to manipulate data with Pandas and Numpy. Currently the posts only cover visualization, since that is what I am most interested in. Rest assured, after reading my blog posts, don't simply expect to know how to use these libraries by reading these posts, but expect to be able to use them well. 

Concerning our visualization blog posts. Currently, this blog covers the basic of Matplotlib. The first blog post, (An Introduction to Visualizations in Python), shows you how to plot a single factor, even if that factor exists in multiple datasets. Additionally, it gives an in-depth coverage of basic plots, such as histograms, boxplots, and density functions. If you have read that post, then you understand how in depth I go into every function so that way you not only can use the plotting functions, but can customize them to look however you wish. You can expect this same quality in future blog posts. 

Additionally, since it is an introductory post, you will also find the basics of creating a small dataset to play with pandas, and some universal Matplotlib functions that apply to any graph that you are creating.

In our second post I will continue to explore Matplotlib by looking at graphs that show two features against each other, such as in scatter plots, and explain them easily enough for you to use them in any situation you need them. Additionally, we will show how to use pandas to retrieve a dataset from the web, which you can then use in your visualization journey as you experiment with various graphs and visualization techniques.

For future posts, expect to see more matplotlib, and then enhancing the graphs we learned from Matplotlib with Seaborn. There may also be a few smaller posts regarding extra Pandas and Numpy features.

With that said, please choose a topic in the header and enjoy learning!
