    "text": "Obtaining a dataset\nIn order to visualize data, we first need to obtain some. We will use pandas to create a small dataset.\nFirst, we begin by importing our required libraries, in this case, pandas and matplotlib.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nNow, we will decide how many features we want our dataset to have. These will become our columns.\nFor this example, our dataset with have 4 features: name, gpa, major, and year\nNext we decide how many entries we want in our dataset. For this example, we will do only 10.\nNow, to do this in code, we first create 4 lists of 10 items.\nname = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Diana\", \"Ethan\", \"Fiona\", \"George\", \"Hannah\", \"Isaac\", \"Julia\"]\n\ngpa = [3.5, 2.8, 3.9, 3.2, 2.5, 3.7, 2.9, 3.8, 3.1, 3.6]  \n\nmajor = [\"Math\", \"Computer Science\", \"Statistics\", \"Math\", \"Computer Science\", \"Statistics\", \"Math\", \"Computer Science\", \"Statistics\", \"Math\"]\n\nyear = [\"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior\", \"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior\", \"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\"]\nNow that we have created our features, we put them into a pandas dataset.\ndata = {\n    \"Name\": name,\n    \"GPA\": gpa,\n    \"Major\": major,\n    \"Year\": year\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\nNow we can begin looking at our data./ Before we start graphing, we can look at a small portion of our data, or the entire set.\ndf.head()\nprint(df)\nNow we can begin plotting our data using matplotlib."
